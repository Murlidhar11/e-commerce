# e-commerce
The e-commerce frontend, or client-side, is what people (i.e. clients) see when they visit your site. Itâ€™s the part of your site that shoppers interact with directly and includes features like fonts, colors, drop-down menus, image sliders, shopping carts, search bars, and product detail pages.
